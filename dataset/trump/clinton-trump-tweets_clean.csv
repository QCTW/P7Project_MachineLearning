HillaryClinton	We believe that everyone has value. We believe that everyone's created equal. We believe that love trumps hate.  __URL__ 
HillaryClinton	We'll make our economy and country more welcoming to people with disabilities. We all win when everyone gets to share in America's promise.
HillaryClinton	The ultimate test of our society is how we treat our fellow human beings, especially those who we have previously left behind.
HillaryClinton	Americans with disabilities deserve the chance to work alongside those without disabilities—to do the same jobs for the same pay &amp; benefits.
HillaryClinton	We’ve got to build an economy that welcomes people with disabilities, values their work, rewards them fairly, and treats them with respect.
HillaryClinton	Over 60% of adults with disabilities aren’t in the workplace. We have to fix that.  __URL__ 
HillaryClinton	The ADA and the notion that workplaces and public spaces belong to everyone was one that Democrats and Republicans could both get behind.
HillaryClinton	None of us gets through life alone. We all have to look out for each other and lift each other up.
HillaryClinton	One of Hillary's first jobs out of law school was to find out why kids with disabilities weren't in school.  __URL__ 
HillaryClinton	Not that long ago, if you had a disability, it defined your entire life. Basic, essential things that others could do, you couldn’t.
HillaryClinton	It's still legal to pay disabled workers less than the minimum wage and Clinton announces her plan to end that:  __URL__ 
HillaryClinton	Building an inclusive economy is another reason we’ve got to break down systemic racism, including under-investment in communities of color.
HillaryClinton	When we leave people out or write them off, we not only shortchange them and their dreams, we shortchange our country and our future.
HillaryClinton	In America, every person, no matter what you look like or who you are, should have the chance to go as far as your dreams will take you.
HillaryClinton	We need to come together to turn the tide, stop violence, build trust, and give all our kids the chance to grow up safe and healthy.
HillaryClinton	We've also seen the targeting of police officers—but so many serve every day with courage and honor and are committed to reform.
HillaryClinton	We have two names to add to a long list of African Americans killed by police officers. It’s unbearable, and it needs to become intolerable.

HillaryClinton	This election isn’t a reality TV show. It shouldn’t be about birth certificates or name-calling or stunts to get on cable news.
DonaldTrump	Great job once again by law enforcement! We are proud of them and should embrace them - without them, we don't have a country!

HillaryClinton	20 questions Trump needs to answer on his dangerous foreign business ties—and the national security risks they pose.  __URL__

HillaryClinton	17. Will your children disclose all of the foreign trips and business deals they've undertaken during the campaign, and with whom they met?

HillaryClinton	15. To what extent are you and your family currently contractually tied to payments from foreign business partners, or governments?
HillaryClinton	14. We know you engaged extensively in pay-to-play here at home. Have you bribed foreign officials or other parties abroad?
HillaryClinton	13. How can we know you won't (again) impulsively damage relationships with crucial allies to preserve your own ego?  __URL__ 
HillaryClinton	12. How can we be sure you'd be willing to be tough on any nation if necessary, if it would put your interests and profits at risk?
HillaryClinton	11. With business ties to politically-connected Indian developers, how can you conduct foreign policy that puts the U.S. above your profits?
HillaryClinton	10. How did the Russian mob boss who ran a criminal organization out of Trump Tower get a VIP pass to your Miss Universe pageant in Moscow?
HillaryClinton	9. Have you or your campaign discussed U.S.-Russian relations with the Russian billionaires with whom you've done business?
HillaryClinton	8. Will you disclose the nature of your personal and business relationships with all of the Russian oligarchs you are “close” to?

HillaryClinton	4. If you were willing to work with Qaddafi—a known terrorist and dictator—is there anyone you aren't willing to make a deal with? Who?
HillaryClinton	3. While refusing to release your tax returns, how will you confirm that you do not have dangerous financial ties to bad actors abroad?
HillaryClinton	2. How will you handle non-cancelable contractual obligations with parties whose interests conflict with those of the United States?
HillaryClinton	1. Will you sever ties with your company linked to foreign leaders, questionable organizations, and criminals if you become president?
HillaryClinton	In light of @kurteichenwald's report on the Trump Organization's dangerous ties, here are 20 questions that Trump needs to answer—now.

HillaryClinton	We need to listen to the dedicated, principled police officers working hard every day to rebuild trust with the communities they serve.

DonaldTrump	Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk, no action -- maybe her Native American name?
DonaldTrump	Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.
HillaryClinton	@JLo thanks for this. Women are so much more than the roles they've been assigned. -H
DonaldTrump	Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.
DonaldTrump	Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy.
DonaldTrump	Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton’s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.
DonaldTrump	Let’s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren’s records to see if she is Native American. I say she’s a fraud!
DonaldTrump	I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.

DonaldTrump	In the last 2 weeks, I had $35M of negative ads against me in Florida &amp; I won in a massive landslide.The establishment should save their $$!
DonaldTrump	Yesterday was amazing—5 victories.  Lyin’ Ted Cruz had zero. Things are going very well!
DonaldTrump	Is this what we want for a President?  __URL__ 
DonaldTrump	.@RepTomMarino  Great job on television this morning. Glad to have you on my side!
DonaldTrump	"@FoxBusiness: .@RepTomMarino: I think @realDonaldTrump can beat HillaryClinton. And I'm looking forward to Trump being president.
DonaldTrump	.@pastormarkburns You were great last night and we all very much appreciate it! Thank you!
DonaldTrump	I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:30 A.M. ENJOY!
DonaldTrump	Will be interviewed on @Morning_Joe at 7:40. ENJOY!
DonaldTrump	Will be interviewed on @NewDay on @CNN at 7:15 A.M.

DonaldTrump	In presidential voting so far, John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him, I will beat Hillary!
DonaldTrump	Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico, now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now!
DonaldTrump	Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate, until I put him down.
DonaldTrump	Mathematically it is statistically impossible for Kasich to get to 1237 - he would need 112% of the remaining delegates to be the nominee!

DonaldTrump	Don't reward Mitt Romney, who let us all down in the last presidential race, by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA, open borders etc.).
DonaldTrump	Please remember, I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists!
DonaldTrump	I will bring our jobs back to America, fix our military and take care of our vets, end Common Core and ObamaCare, protect 2nd A, build WALL
DonaldTrump	Rubio is weak on illegal immigration, with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
DonaldTrump	Kasich voted for NAFTA, a disaster for Ohio, and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness!

DonaldTrump	Ohio Gov.Kasich voted for NAFTA, from which Ohio has never recovered. Now he wants TPP, which will be even worse. Ohio steel and coal dying!

DonaldTrump	I only wish my wonderful father, Fred, gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight Rubio says. He didn't - total fabrication!

DonaldTrump	I am self-funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight Rubio or Ted Cruz!

DonaldTrump	Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is, he is a choker, and once a choker, always a choker! Mr. Meltdown.
DonaldTrump	Wow, every poll said I won the debate last night. Great honor!
DonaldTrump	Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage. Not presidential material!
DonaldTrump	Lying Ted Cruz and lightweight choker  Marco Rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement. They failed!
DonaldTrump	Will be at Fort Worth (Texas) Convention Center at 11:30 A.M. Big crowd - get there early! Big announcement to be made!
DonaldTrump	Why would the people of Florida vote for Marco Rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their Senator and then quit!
DonaldTrump	Have a good chance to win Texas on Tuesday. Cruz is a nasty guy, not one Senate endorsement and, despite talk, gets nothing done. Loser!

DonaldTrump	Just saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false, more dirty tricks. He got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy?
DonaldTrump	Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support!
DonaldTrump	Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics!
DonaldTrump	Wow, Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks!

DonaldTrump	Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. &amp; is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi, low interest loans. No legal disclosure &amp; never sold off assets.
DonaldTrump	Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.
DonaldTrump	Cruz says I supported TARP, which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs, the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet!
DonaldTrump	The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!
DonaldTrump	.@BrentBozell, one of the National Review lightweights, came to my office begging for money like a dog. Why doesn't he say that?

DonaldTrump	Great even in SC tonight! Fire Marshall would not let everyone in-- 5,000 turned away. Thank you for coming!
DonaldTrump	Will be at venue, in wonderful South Carolina, very soon. Big traffic back-up, tremendous crowd! Will be wild.

DonaldTrump	Love seeing union &amp; non-union members alike are defecting to Trump. I will create jobs like no one else. Their #Dem leaders can’t compete!
DonaldTrump	I hope all workers demand that their @Teamsters reps endorse Donald J. Trump. Nobody knows jobs like I do! Don’t let them sell you out!
DonaldTrump	On my way to South Carolina. Big Crowd--- look forward to it!
DonaldTrump	Not good news for Jeb Bush   __URL__ 
DonaldTrump	Hank Greenberg, formerly of AIG, gave $10 million to the @JebBush campaign 3 months ago. He is not happy, a total waste of money!

DonaldTrump	I'm leaving now for Burlington, Vermont. It will be wild!
DonaldTrump	Joy Behar, who was fired from her last show for lack of ratings, is even worse on @TheView. We love Barbara!
DonaldTrump	The @TheView @ABC, once great when headed by @BarbaraJWalters, is now in total freefall. Whoopi Goldberg is terrible. Very sad!

DonaldTrump	Weak &amp; ineffective @JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising!
DonaldTrump	I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster. Try using your last name and don't be ashamed of it!
DonaldTrump	.@SenTedCruz Ted--free legal advice on how to pre-empt the Dems on citizen issue. Go to court now &amp; seek Declaratory Judgment--you will win!
DonaldTrump	Massive crowd in VT tonight. Venue not big enough. Officials say NO to outside event and sound system. Arrive early!
DonaldTrump	Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level. Germany is a total mess-big crime. GET SMART!
DonaldTrump	I will be in beautiful Burlington, Vermont, tonight for a rally. Will be great fun. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
DonaldTrump	It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago. Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted!
DonaldTrump	.@Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&amp;P last year, plunging 46%. Very disloyal company. Another win for Trump! Boycott.
DonaldTrump	The failing @UnionLeader newspaper in N.H. just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads. How stupid, how desperate!
DonaldTrump	Do you believe that @UnionLeader in NH was demanding ads? Look at enclosed letter from them, just received:  __URL__

DonaldTrump	I don’t cheat at golf but @SamuelLJackson cheats—with his game he has no choice—and stop doing commercials!
DonaldTrump	HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my son, @EricTrump! Very proud of you!  __URL__   __URL__

AdamSavage	Well, I have to sign off now, a little early. Thanks for watching #brexit -- I mean, #BattleBots -- with me!
AdamSavage	Frequently people are eliminated by their own mistakes. It can be awful. #BattleBots
AdamSavage	I love it when people's robots work the way they designed them. #Battlebots
AdamSavage	My single favorite part of Robot Wars and #Battlebots was how the teams helped each other with problems. It's a lovely camaraderie.
AdamSavage	I can’t stress enough how hard it is to build a bot that can withstand that kind of damage. The amount of abuse is astonishing. #BattleBots
AdamSavage	The kind of abuse a #Battlebots robot receives is like getting run over by a car or being hit by a sledgehammer.
AdamSavage	When we were first on #Battlebots, we all dressed in black and none of us spoke. We wanted to be mysterious and freaky.
AdamSavage	.... and I also helped @FonHDavis with Mouser Mecha-Catbot at #Battlebots. So @BattleBots and I have a LONG history.pic.twitter.com/jHZ1NvHgPx
AdamSavage	I also helped @grantimahara with the first Deadblow at the first #Battlebots.pic.twitter.com/ZNfwINIOGJ
AdamSavage	Blendo was twice awarded first place in lieu of final competition (for insurance reasons-long story). #BattleBots
AdamSavage	Blendo was designed by @JamieNoTweet. I built, among other things, the R/C control systems. #BattleBotspic.twitter.com/k5zLHaOAA4
AdamSavage	My first robot combat was 1995. I was on the original team that took Blendo to Robot Wars. #BattleBots
AdamSavage	This shoot was like a high school reunion for me. I knew so many of the #Battlebots teams and judges.
AdamSavage	I'd wanted to participate last year, but #Battlebots conflicted with @mythbusters production. I was sad.
AdamSavage	Not only am I a guest judge on tonight's @BattleBotsABC, but I'll Tweet during the West Coast premiere!pic.twitter.com/8Q60d3nW8k

AdamSavage	Helpful hint #3: Remember, bring along a saw for ice fishing -- your dynamite won't make a dent in the stuff.
AdamSavage	Another helpful tip for those stuck in the snow: When fighting AT-ATs remember to use your tow cables; that armor is too strong for blasters
AdamSavage	Helpful hint for those caught in the snow: you're better off eating your tauntaun than sleeping in him.pic.twitter.com/GyNwDuVTdR
AdamSavage	We ALSO never tested shooting at someone from UNDER the ice (like @TheSlyStallone does in Cliffhanger). #untriedmyths #blizzard2016
AdamSavage	We also never tested shooting at ice while you're falling toward it (like in the AWESOME Long Kiss Goodnight). #untriedmyths #blizzard2016
AdamSavage	Speaking of #blizzard2016 I always wanted to dress @JamieNoTweet up as Santa and run him though time trials down a chimney. #untriedmyths

AdamSavage	You can watch last night's MacGyver mail truck explosion in full 360 VR, narrated by me! http://www.discoveryvr.com/watch/blowing-up-a-postal-van … @MythBusters
AdamSavage	We all marveled how much the MacGyver wig matched my natural colors. I still have it. #Mythbusterspic.twitter.com/zQIUcQy4kN
AdamSavage	For those asking, yes, this was the same Land Cruiser from my steering mishap last year.http://jalopnik.com/mythbuster-used-a-homemade-siren-to-avoid-accident-afte-1739988808 …
AdamSavage	Well, that's it for the #MythBusters Explosion Special. Thanks for watching! Next week, it's Tanker Crush.pic.twitter.com/krqRmFGiYt
AdamSavage	Yes, it's coming later this season. Don't worry. #MythBusterspic.twitter.com/jZEQYGfCIJ
AdamSavage	As an aside, you know, they actually had a scientific consultant on MacGyver. A gemologist named John Koivula. #Mythbusters
AdamSavage	I see a few questions about my Land Cruiser. I talked to @MotorTrend about it:http://www.motortrend.com/news/celebrity-drive-adam-savage-mythbuster-drift-lover/ …
AdamSavage	That's my own 1982 Toyota Land Cruiser BJ42, originally from New Zealand. I love driving it.pic.twitter.com/DjgowdZwPU

AdamSavage	Even though I knew this was safe, it was still terrifying. #MythBusterspic.twitter.com/gFZ1rARngp

AdamSavage	It was only afterward I realized that we'd kind of built a MacGyver sequence right into our MacGyver episode. #Mythbusters
AdamSavage	Mines most often kill people who have no dog in the fight, and it's sometimes decades later. #MythBusters
AdamSavage	Let me just say here a word about land mines. They're just one of the the worst ideas ever. #MythBusters
AdamSavage	Over the course of #MythBusters' 14 years, we've detonated 20.5 TONS of explosives.
AdamSavage	Driving the hovercraft was as fun as it looked. Even @jamienotweet enjoyed it. #MythBusterspic.twitter.com/6iExVOu8Qp
AdamSavage	Come on. You know we couldn't end #mythbusters without another MacGyver myth!
AdamSavage	Ione, CA, is a beautiful town. (Sorry about all the booms over the years.) #MythBusters
AdamSavage	.#MythBusters couldn't have done many of our best explosions w/o the amazing assistance & encouragement from the excellent people of Ione CA
AdamSavage	Don't worry, we do blow up another cement truck. It'll be in the #MythBusters finale later this year.

AdamSavage	.@JamieNoTweet and I will see you next Saturday. Here’s a sneak peek: http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/indiana-jones-trailer/ … #MythBusters
AdamSavage	Well, guys, we hope you enjoyed our season 10 premiere! #MythBusters
AdamSavage	Can I say how creepy it was to stand next to full-size Homer? His proportions are absolutely bizarre when human sizedpic.twitter.com/ZEC78GHiD9
AdamSavage	You never know what’s going to end up holding you back when you're doing a build or experiment. #MythBusters
AdamSavage	We called fireworks experts only to find out that real cherry bombs were unachievable. So we made our own. #MythBusters
AdamSavage	It was a little bizarre to us that the cherry bombs were so hard to find. #MythBusters
AdamSavage	Personally, what I’d like to know is how hard it is actually to catch a roadrunner. #MythBusters
AdamSavage	I would actually LOVE to tackle some Wile E. Coyote myths. We’ve talked about it for years. #MythBusters
AdamSavage	For me, it is deeply scientific to show that what we do is a messy process. #MythBusters
AdamSavage	Seeing more of our process means you’re also seeing more of our problems and screw-ups. #MythBusters
AdamSavage	We’re so proud to have been part of @TheSimpsons & proud to have them part of #MythBusters.
AdamSavage	Another change is that we rely more on Blackmagic cameras (with prime lenses), which give the show a very cinematic look. #MythBusters
AdamSavage	One change we made to the show was adding more process back into the builds. #MythBusters
AdamSavage	It took time to pick which @TheSimpsons myths to test. We wanted to find stories where the physics had some testable basis. #MythBusters
AdamSavage	What do you guys think of the new open? (I love it!) #MythBusters
AdamSavage	We’re HUGE fans of @TheSimpsons and the people who make it. #MythBusters
AdamSavage	A sneak peek of tonight's @MythBusters @TheSimpsons premiere!http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/setting-the-scene/ …

AdamSavage	Enjoy #SharkWeek and the rest of your summer, and see you in 2015 with all-new episodes that have an all-new look! #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	.@JamieNoTweet and I are off to Australia for our @MythBusters tour next week, so we’ll see some of you there. #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	A sneak peek from next week's episode. And we hope this episode improves the human condition! http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/plane-boarding-trailer.htm … #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	Often we’re doing experiments and we’re hoping to find just ANY difference. To find one that large is really significant. #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	20% is a massive difference in efficiency. #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	Any Europeans here? Do you think your roundabouts are more efficient than four way stops? #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	The Segway is an awesome traffic barrier movement tool. #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	Sometimes I'd rather drive instead of fly because it takes so long to go through security. @JamieNoTweet travel by bus during our tour....
AdamSavage	.@ToryBelleci! Potty mouth. #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	I have never seen @JamieNoTweet so fluid and it was awesome, watching him direct traffic. #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	I love roundabouts. #RoundaboutsRock #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	For us, it was really really hilarious. Traffic jams were happening before we even tried to cause them. #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	With all the training we've gotten as drivers on @MythBusters, my driving has DEFINITELY gotten better. #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	One thing @JamieNoTweet and I can’t stand is sitting at traffic lights when there’s no one around. #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	As a San Francisco resident, doing a @MythBusters episode on traffic was TOTALLY appropriate. #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	This is actually our last Watch With this season. We leave in a few days for Australia on our @MythBusters tour. #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	Keep your questions coming — we’re rolling right into our second hour of Watch With Live! #MythBustersLive

AdamSavage	I am VERY interested in the  __QUOTE__  results. #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	#SHARKWEEK returns NEXT WEEK! #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	It's actually amazing to see how much the wigs changed people's looks. #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	We actually had film industry hair stylists on set to make sure the wigs all looked natural and were properly styled. #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	I actually met my wife online. #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	I think there was a portion of my single life that could have been classified as speed dating, but it wasn’t official. #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	I loved setting up this test for gentlemen prefer blondes. This was SO much fun. #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	These results were SO weird. That people preferred MY sweaty shirt. #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	I broke my watch when I fell on the treadmill that original time. #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	Ow. It's really painful to watch myself fall repeatedly. #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	We tried to get an attractive actor to contribute his work-out shirt, but it didn't work out. #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	Didn’t expect that women would tip more too. #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	What do you guys think? Will bigger breasts mean bigger tips? #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	I know. I'm laughing at my own line. #MythBustersLive
AdamSavage	I really love the Stroop Test. #MythBustersLive

AdamSavage	We don’t think anyone has ever gotten a ping pong ball to go faster but it hasn't been certified yet by Guinness. @GWRnews. #MythMatch
AdamSavage	What do you guys think of the @musicalscience video? http://dsc.tv/u8F88 
AdamSavage	I try not to swear while we’re filming, but sometimes ... #MythMatch

AdamSavage	There’s nothing we won’t at least try to shoot in high speed. #MythMatch
AdamSavage	The threshold for lethality is something we grapple with on every story in which it’s a factor. #MythMatch
AdamSavage	We expected the ping pong ball to go through the cardboard, but not make a mark on the plywood beneath. #MythMatch
AdamSavage	Professional ping pong balls are heavier and more perfectly spherical, and come in either white or orange. #MythMatch
AdamSavage	It should be noted that @JamieNoTweet has a degree in Russian linguistics. #MythMatch
AdamSavage	Ice bullet was actually our first @MythBusters episode once we went to full series. #MythMatch

AdamSavage	Although we still have our deep fryer, so we could fry things and film them later on. #BulletBusters
AdamSavage	I’m a little sad about it. I wanted to film sticks of butter and doughnuts frying. #BulletBusters
AdamSavage	We really wanted to make some fried food in that fryer and film it on the high-speed camera. #BulletBusters
AdamSavage	Really surprising result. Another example of where we end up finding out stuff we’re not looking for. #BulletBusters
AdamSavage	Explosions are actually bigger in space. Who knew? #BulletBusters
AdamSavage	The accelerant inside a bullet has its own oxygenator which means that it doesn’t need oxygen in the air to fire. #BulletBusters
AdamSavage	I have a bent barrel gun with the stock left over from that shoot. #BulletBusters
AdamSavage	This result was a total surprise. #BulletBusters
AdamSavage	Somehow while on set @JamieNoTweet found time to make a self-correcting pistol. #BulletBusters
AdamSavage	Nice use of the Wilhelm Scream. #BulletBusters
AdamSavage	Or not.
AdamSavage	We thought the existence of bent-barrel guns was a remarkable fact totally worth testing to prove their feasibility. #BulletBusters
AdamSavage	Did anyone here not know that guns with bent barrels exist? #BulletBusters
AdamSavage	When things move very fast, like bullets do, they impact the world in ways that are hard to see and predict. #BulletBusters

AdamSavage	One of our top 5 @MythBusters high-speeds ever, in my opinion.http://bit.ly/1kNJdgx 
AdamSavage	.@JamieNoTweet spent 3 hours at the top of that scary crane as we dropped Buster from it repeatedly.#flashbackfridaypic.twitter.com/RZXMOSHuEt
AdamSavage	He has no idea what  __QUOTE__  means, but @JamieNoTweet is good at it, as it turns out. Proof: http://bit.ly/1d696kZ  @MythBusters
AdamSavage	Ready. #BumperBusters @MythBusterspic.twitter.com/j4tWZQBvod
AdamSavage	Check out the EXPLOSIVE new @XFINITY commercial @JamieNoTweet and I are in! http://youtu.be/a4JNeyyiJ-8 
AdamSavage	Yes. In this sneak-peek photo from Jan 18's @MythBusters premiere, Car Crash Cliches, @JamieNoTweet IS SMILING.pic.twitter.com/nr4lI5b9AV
AdamSavage	A terrific article about one of the things I particularly like about @lenadunham's Girls: http://theweek.com/article/index/254981/lena-dunhams-body-reveals-the-naked-truth-about-our-distorted-values …  Fomenting a needed debate.
AdamSavage	Here's a link to the @MythBusters Moonshiner Myths Aftershow I mentioned during the Watch With event last night!http://bit.ly/1iD6tcx 
AdamSavage	I just had a fanboy squee moment, with both @mathowie and @deadmau5 watching #DangerousToys last night!
AdamSavage	Thanks so much for watching @MythBusters and #DangerousToys and Tweeting with us!
AdamSavage	We had this idea of building giant heads with our likeness, outfitting them with Go-Pros and doing hand combat. #dangeroustoys
AdamSavage	At that point, it just seemed easier to throw the stink bombs. #dangeroustoys
AdamSavage	Obviously.
AdamSavage	It was actually extraordinarily hard to hit those bears. #dangeroustoys
AdamSavage	Totally didn’t mean to fall. #dangeroustoys
AdamSavage	We called all over SF trying to get enough surgical tubing for my slingshot. Finally, we found 3 stores that between them had enough.
AdamSavage	No matter how bad you tell someone something smells, they’ll still smell it when you ask them. #dangeroustoys
AdamSavage	Seriously. Really, really bad. #dangeroustoys
AdamSavage	We bought the 41 couches at a hotel-furniture liquidator. Can you guess which hotel most came from? #dangeroustoys
AdamSavage	The fort took so long to assemble on location, I didn’t have much time in the shop to work on my defensive weapons. #dangeroustoys
AdamSavage	The battle scene was shot on a private ranch about an hour from San Francisco. It was gorgeous. #dangeroustoys
AdamSavage	We always use white boards when we’re figuring things out. #dangeroustoys
AdamSavage	We'll be doing a Q&A LIVE in a few minutes at discovery .com/DangerousToysLive! Keep sending questions using #DangerousToys.
AdamSavage	Gotta hate the wedgie. #dangeroustoys
AdamSavage	The kids were really fun to work with. And for me and @jamienotweet their input was key to the show. #dangeroustoys
AdamSavage	We shot #dangeroustoys during a two-week break from @MythBusters.
AdamSavage	These kids ranged in age from 4 to 9. @JamieNoTweet was never that age. #dangeroustoys
AdamSavage	As most of you know, I have two sons, Thing1 and Thing2. They’re 14 now. #dangeroustoys
AdamSavage	Cops and donuts. Myth? #mythanol
AdamSavage	I enjoy watching the high speed footage right afterward more than seeing it live. #mythanol
AdamSavage	I never get tired of explosions.  #mythanol
AdamSavage	In 11 years of filming @mythbusters, we’ve had 840 explosions. #mythanol
AdamSavage	We’re great at starting fires. Putting them out, on the other hand … #mythanol
AdamSavage	Failure is always an option. Clearly. #mythanol
AdamSavage	.JamieNoTweet’s favorite alcohol myth is when he tried to slap me sober. #mythanol
AdamSavage	We’ve destroyed 120 vehicles on @MythBusters so far. #mythanol
AdamSavage	Wait. Is @GrantImahara wearing mascara? #mythanol
AdamSavage	You need an ATF license to manufacture moonshine. Don’t try this at home! #mythanol
AdamSavage	It took quite a lot of work to get permission to “brew” here in shop. #mythanol
AdamSavage	I look so different here. So young. Jamie looks exactly the same. #mythanol

AdamSavage	One of my favorite episodes ever.
AdamSavage	I really thought Luke was dead as a doornail. #sithbusters
AdamSavage	I stand by our freezer experiment’s circumstances on Hoth. #sithbusters
AdamSavage	If it’s worth doing, it’s worth overdoing. #sithbusters
AdamSavage	Big builds that we can really sink our teeth into don’t actually happen that often. This was awesome. #sithbusters
AdamSavage	I enjoy building things like the tauntaun a lot more than explosions. #sithbusters
AdamSavage	The Stormtroopers all came from @501stLegion and they were amazing. #sithbusters @mythbusters
AdamSavage	Yes, you can see we had a few Scout Troopers from Return of the Jedi. I had no problem with that.
AdamSavage	I love the @StarWars inspired transitions. #sithbusters @mythbusters
AdamSavage	I must give @jamienotweet props for dressing as Luke Skywalker. He really went above and beyond. #sithbusters
AdamSavage	How will we ever top that opening? @Starwars music, a @starwars crawl AND @JamieNoTweet in a wig. #sithbusters @mythbusters

AdamSavage	You can all have pi, but c'mon, that's irrational . . . (heh. heh.  get it? irrational number?  Pi? No?  sigh.  Never mind)

KimKardashian	The fact that anyone can so easily access guns is so scary & after all of the devastating loss the Senate should have not failed us!!!
KimKardashian	Oh & mentally ill people can buy guns without a background check too.
KimKardashian	So sad! The senate voted against background checks being needed to buy guns. So terrorists on fbi's wanted lists can legally still buy guns

KimKardashian	Wait prosecutors agreed to drop the murder charges, but they will continue to oppose Cook’s claims of actual innocence. Always a hang up!
KimKardashian	His chargers were just dropped after DNA evidence was finally brought in and cleared him. Can u imagine being wrongly imprisoned for 40 yrs
KimKardashian	Just read the story of Kerry Max Cook. He had been on death row for a murder he didn't commit for almost 40 years.

KimKardashian	We have repeatedly called on Congress to close this loophole that makes it easy for dangerous people to get guns & kill.
KimKardashian	Under current federal law people on terror watch lists can legally buy guns – this is called the Terror Gap

RichardDawkins	If the authorities really thought it might be a bomb, why did they not evacuate the building? Casts doubt on their motive for arresting him.
RichardDawkins	I'm not putting down the child. I'm putting down myself & the rest of us for being fooled. And the police for arresting him for nothing.

RichardDawkins	Even worse for rape victims, in some societies women are blamed, shunned & even prosecuted for BEING RAPED. No wonder they don't report it.
RichardDawkins	.@Danny_Barbera Alas, the forensic details of reporting a rape can be so unpleasant many women understandably prefer not to prosecute.
RichardDawkins	No, I don't blame the woman now being exploited as click bait by New Statesman. The awful headline was probably written by a sub-editor..
RichardDawkins	@c0nc0rdance Yes, amazingly, males have rights too. Males are raped too. Males get drunk too. & an accused is innocent until proved guilty.
RichardDawkins	New Statesman, you know my number. Why headline an accusatory question to me, when you could have phoned me and asked? Yes I believe her.
RichardDawkins	Obviously some drunk people remember well what happened. I was talking about a limited case where a witness admits she can't remember.
RichardDawkins	In my tweets I explicitly stated that I was considering the hypothetical case of a woman who testified that she COULDN'T REMEMBER.
RichardDawkins	Yes, I believe you. Why would I not? Unlike the hypothetical case of my tweets, you have clear & convincing memories. http://www.newstatesman.com/voices/2014/09/i-was-raped-when-i-was-drunk-i-was-14-do-you-believe-me-richard-dawkins …

RichardDawkins	.@em_dash01  Agreed. But also too drunk to provide enough testimony to jail someone. What if he claims he also was too drunk to consent?
RichardDawkins	.@faufcb  Yes. And there's also a presumption of innocence till proved guilty. Too drunk to REMEMBER is evidence to put someone in JAIL?

RichardDawkins	Blogger said woman's rights over own body extend to abortion even if fetus conscious & writing poetry in womb. I profoundly disagree. 1/2
RichardDawkins	If you honestly think abortion = murdering the person the fetus might have become, we've reached the deep root of our disagreement.
RichardDawkins	Every sperm is sacred __URL__  …
RichardDawkins	Oh for goodness sake, if abortion was really the same as murdering babies nobody would favour it. Isn't it OBVIOUS you're missing the point?

RichardDawkins	Cry Havoc. Abortion and Down Syndrome. An apology for letting slip the dogs of Twitterwar:    __URL__  …
RichardDawkins	Down Syndrome screening is not eugenic: DS has extremely low heritability. Screening offers a humane moral choice. Majority choose abortion.
RichardDawkins	Women have a right to early abortion. Choice is theirs. Down Syndrome is 1 of the commonest  & most moral reasons to exercise that right.
RichardDawkins	If I were a woman with a DS fetus I personally would abort. So do most women in fact. If you wouldn't, good luck to you, it's your decision,
RichardDawkins	Woman said she wouldn't know whether to abort. I told her what I would do & why. I OBVIOUSLY wouldn't TELL a woman what to do. Up to her.

RichardDawkins	A woman whom I know & like said she'd be uncertain what to do if pregnant with Downs. I said what I'd do & why. Happens to be what most do.
RichardDawkins	I do not for one moment apologise for approaching moral philosophic questions in a logical way. There's a place for emotion & this isn't it.
RichardDawkins	Down syndrome screening is NOT eugenic. Almost always caused by non-hereditary chromosomal abnormality, heavily influenced by maternal age.
RichardDawkins	So, is anyone who doesn't follow Roman Catholic  __QUOTE__  on abortion beyond the pale? Well I'm proud to be beyond that particular pale.
RichardDawkins	If you don't understand the point, look up  __QUOTE__  in The God Delusion.
RichardDawkins	Most countries accept a woman's right to abort. Elementary moral philosophy says this does NOT cast doubt on existing people's right to life
RichardDawkins	@dasendri Yes. Choice. People are entitled to make their choice. I stated the choice I would make. And that's the choice most often made.
RichardDawkins	Apparently I'm a horrid monster for recommending WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS to the great majority of Down Syndrome fetuses. They are aborted.
RichardDawkins	There's a profound moral difference between  __QUOTE__ 
RichardDawkins	In point of fact, a majority of Down Syndrome fetuses in Europe and USA are aborted. What I recommended is not outlandish but the norm.
RichardDawkins	@InYourFaceNYer People on that spectrum have a great deal to contribute, Maybe even an enhanced ability in some respects. DS not enhanced.
RichardDawkins	@InYourFaceNYer Abort it and try again. It would be immoral to bring it into the world if you have the choice.
RichardDawkins	@StarTraveller @AidanMcCourt Learn to think in non-essentialist ways. The question is not  __QUOTE__

RichardDawkins	.@AidanMcCourt Yes, it is very civilised. These are fetuses, diagnosed before they have human feelings.

RichardDawkins	Whether X or Y is worse is a matter of opinion. But it is a matter of LOGIC that to express that opinion doesn't mean you approve of either.
RichardDawkins	Yes yes, you rank X and Y differently. Fine. Whichever you rank as worse, it is still illogical to interpret that as approval of the other.
RichardDawkins	If you prefer to think date rape is worse than knifepoint, simply reverse my syllogism. To say Y is worse than X is not an endorsement of Y.
RichardDawkins	Date rape is bad. Stranger rape at knifepoint is worse. If you think that's an endorsement of date rape, go away and learn how to think.

RichardDawkins	Case in point: Obviously many philosophers “anticipated” Darwinism. But nobody before Darwin & Wallace saw its devastating significance.
RichardDawkins	On a Twitter roll, you write each new tweet in the context of its predecessors, forgetting that many readers aren’t seeing that context.
RichardDawkins	Yes indeed, it seems that Darwin needed the Beagle, not just an armchair. Er, that was kind of my POINT!
RichardDawkins	It's precisely BECAUSE philosophers did so many other brilliant things that I expressed amazement that they missed natural selection.
RichardDawkins	Goodness, I hit a nerve! I'm genuinely CURIOUS why Darwin's idea, simple enough to need only an armchair, had to wait for 19thC naturalists
RichardDawkins	Philosophers' historic failure to anticipate Darwin is a severe indictment of philosophy. Happy Darwin Day!
RichardDawkins	Extraterrestrials, if they are intelligent enough to communicate with us, will all honour their equivalent of Darwin. Happy Darwin Day!
RichardDawkins	Darwin amazingly showed that complex, apparent design doesn't need a designer. Designers are unparsimoniously superfluous. Happy Darwin Day!
RichardDawkins	Darwin's idea – the most powerful idea ever? – is also spectacularly simple. Maybe that's why philosophers overlooked it. Happy Darwin Day.
RichardDawkins	Great philosophers like Hume could see the fallacy in Intelligent Design, but spectacularly failed to get the alternative. Happy Darwin Day!
