0	The ultimate test of our society is how we treat our fellow human beings, especially those who we have previously left behind.
0	Americans with disabilities deserve the chance to work alongside those without disabilities—to do the same jobs for the same pay &amp; benefits.

0	We need to come together to turn the tide, stop violence, build trust, and give all our kids the chance to grow up safe and healthy.
0	We've also seen the targeting of police officers—but so many serve every day with courage and honor and are committed to reform.
0	We have two names to add to a long list of African Americans killed by police officers. It’s unbearable, and it needs to become intolerable.

1	Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesn't want to run against. Will be such fun!
1	Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work!
1	Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system, I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him.
1	I'll be in one of my favorite places this morning, Staten Island. Big crowd, will be fun!

1	.@FoxNews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night. $6,000,000 raised in one hour for our VETS.
1	Amazing that Ted Cruz can't even get a Senator like @BenSasse, who is easy, to endorse him. Not one Senator  is endorsing Canada Ted!
1	.@BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U.S. Senator. How the hell did he ever get elected?  @greta
1	The great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols.
1	The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum, how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?

1	Jeb Bush, who did poorly last night in the debate and whose chances of winning are zero, just got Graham endorsement. Graham quit at O.

1	United States looks more and more like a paper tiger. Won't be that way if I win!
1	Iran humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors. Horrible pictures &amp; images. We are weak. I will NOT forget!
1	Stuart Stevens is a dumb guy who fails @ virtually everything he touches. Romney campaign,his book,etc. Why does @andersoncooper put him on?
1	Why does @CNN &amp; @andersoncooper waste airtime by putting failed campaign strategist, Stuart Stevens - who lost BIG for Romney - on the show?

1	Iran toys with U.S. days before we pay them, ridiculously, billions of dollars. Don't release money. We want our hostages back NOW!
1	Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton. In a race with her, voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. history-I get most new voters!
1	The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast!
1	Just found out that @tedcruz is spending a fortune on Iowa push polls negative to me. Not nice, but OK! New polls are great.
1	The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow, lethargic - very hard to watch!
1	The Iran deal is terrible. Why didn't we get the uranium stockpile - it was sent to Russia. #SOTU

1	Face The Nation's interview of me was the highest rated show that they have had in 15 years. Congratulations and WOW!  @CBSNews @jdickerson

1	So professional of @ABC news to throw out the failing @UnionLeader newspaper from their debate. Paper won't survive, highly unethical!
1	Great job on Fox this morning @KatiePavlich. I am sending out for your book immediately. Thank you very much!
1	Congratulations to my friend @TheSlyStallone on winning a #GoldenGlobe. A wonderful guy- who has created something special- well deserved!
1	Why does @ThisWeekABC w/ @GStephanopoulos allow a hater &amp; racist like @tavissmiley to waste good airtime? @ABC can do much better than him!
1	Thank you to our law enforcement officers! #LESM #Trump2016  __URL__ 
1	Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters, try getting a new publisher!
1	UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH.
1	This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.
1	If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isn’t questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who can’t win.
1	I am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate.  __URL__ 
1	Remember, get TIME magazine! I am on the cover. Take it out in 4 years and read it again! Just watch...
1	Heading now for Reno, Nevada, for a big rally. Good poll numberd all over!
1	In the just out @FoxNews Poll, I easily beat Hillary Clinton - and I havn't even focused on her yet. On our way: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
1	Yesterday in Iowa was amazing - two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds. They love that I am the only candidate self-funding!

1	Pat Buchanan gave a fantastic interview this morning on @CNN - way to go Pat, way ahead of your time!

1	It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago. Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted!
1	.@Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&amp;P last year, plunging 46%. Very disloyal company. Another win for Trump! Boycott.
1	The failing @UnionLeader newspaper in N.H. just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads. How stupid, how desperate!
1	Do you believe that @UnionLeader in NH was demanding ads? Look at enclosed letter from them, just received:  __URL__
