HillaryClinton	We believe that everyone has value. We believe that everyone's created equal. We believe that love trumps hate.  __URL__ 
HillaryClinton	We'll make our economy and country more welcoming to people with disabilities. We all win when everyone gets to share in America's promise.
HillaryClinton	The ultimate test of our society is how we treat our fellow human beings, especially those who we have previously left behind.
HillaryClinton	Americans with disabilities deserve the chance to work alongside those without disabilities—to do the same jobs for the same pay &amp; benefits.
HillaryClinton	We’ve got to build an economy that welcomes people with disabilities, values their work, rewards them fairly, and treats them with respect.
HillaryClinton	Over 60% of adults with disabilities aren’t in the workplace. We have to fix that.  __URL__ 
HillaryClinton	The ADA and the notion that workplaces and public spaces belong to everyone was one that Democrats and Republicans could both get behind.
HillaryClinton	None of us gets through life alone. We all have to look out for each other and lift each other up.
HillaryClinton	One of Hillary's first jobs out of law school was to find out why kids with disabilities weren't in school.  __URL__ 
HillaryClinton	Not that long ago, if you had a disability, it defined your entire life. Basic, essential things that others could do, you couldn’t.
HillaryClinton	It's still legal to pay disabled workers less than the minimum wage and Clinton announces her plan to end that:  __URL__ 
HillaryClinton	Building an inclusive economy is another reason we’ve got to break down systemic racism, including under-investment in communities of color.
HillaryClinton	When we leave people out or write them off, we not only shortchange them and their dreams, we shortchange our country and our future.
HillaryClinton	In America, every person, no matter what you look like or who you are, should have the chance to go as far as your dreams will take you.
HillaryClinton	We need to come together to turn the tide, stop violence, build trust, and give all our kids the chance to grow up safe and healthy.
HillaryClinton	We've also seen the targeting of police officers—but so many serve every day with courage and honor and are committed to reform.
HillaryClinton	We have two names to add to a long list of African Americans killed by police officers. It’s unbearable, and it needs to become intolerable.

HillaryClinton	This election isn’t a reality TV show. It shouldn’t be about birth certificates or name-calling or stunts to get on cable news.
DonaldTrump	Great job once again by law enforcement! We are proud of them and should embrace them - without them, we don't have a country!

HillaryClinton	20 questions Trump needs to answer on his dangerous foreign business ties—and the national security risks they pose.  __URL__

HillaryClinton	17. Will your children disclose all of the foreign trips and business deals they've undertaken during the campaign, and with whom they met?

HillaryClinton	15. To what extent are you and your family currently contractually tied to payments from foreign business partners, or governments?
HillaryClinton	14. We know you engaged extensively in pay-to-play here at home. Have you bribed foreign officials or other parties abroad?
HillaryClinton	13. How can we know you won't (again) impulsively damage relationships with crucial allies to preserve your own ego?  __URL__ 
HillaryClinton	12. How can we be sure you'd be willing to be tough on any nation if necessary, if it would put your interests and profits at risk?
HillaryClinton	11. With business ties to politically-connected Indian developers, how can you conduct foreign policy that puts the U.S. above your profits?
HillaryClinton	10. How did the Russian mob boss who ran a criminal organization out of Trump Tower get a VIP pass to your Miss Universe pageant in Moscow?
HillaryClinton	9. Have you or your campaign discussed U.S.-Russian relations with the Russian billionaires with whom you've done business?
HillaryClinton	8. Will you disclose the nature of your personal and business relationships with all of the Russian oligarchs you are “close” to?

HillaryClinton	4. If you were willing to work with Qaddafi—a known terrorist and dictator—is there anyone you aren't willing to make a deal with? Who?
HillaryClinton	3. While refusing to release your tax returns, how will you confirm that you do not have dangerous financial ties to bad actors abroad?
HillaryClinton	2. How will you handle non-cancelable contractual obligations with parties whose interests conflict with those of the United States?
HillaryClinton	1. Will you sever ties with your company linked to foreign leaders, questionable organizations, and criminals if you become president?
HillaryClinton	In light of @kurteichenwald's report on the Trump Organization's dangerous ties, here are 20 questions that Trump needs to answer—now.

HillaryClinton	We need to listen to the dedicated, principled police officers working hard every day to rebuild trust with the communities they serve.

DonaldTrump	Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk, no action -- maybe her Native American name?
DonaldTrump	Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.
HillaryClinton	@JLo thanks for this. Women are so much more than the roles they've been assigned. -H
DonaldTrump	Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.
DonaldTrump	Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy.
DonaldTrump	Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton’s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.
DonaldTrump	Let’s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren’s records to see if she is Native American. I say she’s a fraud!
DonaldTrump	I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.

DonaldTrump	In the last 2 weeks, I had $35M of negative ads against me in Florida &amp; I won in a massive landslide.The establishment should save their $$!
DonaldTrump	Yesterday was amazing—5 victories.  Lyin’ Ted Cruz had zero. Things are going very well!
DonaldTrump	Is this what we want for a President?  __URL__ 
DonaldTrump	.@RepTomMarino  Great job on television this morning. Glad to have you on my side!
DonaldTrump	"@FoxBusiness: .@RepTomMarino: I think @realDonaldTrump can beat HillaryClinton. And I'm looking forward to Trump being president.
DonaldTrump	.@pastormarkburns You were great last night and we all very much appreciate it! Thank you!
DonaldTrump	I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:30 A.M. ENJOY!
DonaldTrump	Will be interviewed on @Morning_Joe at 7:40. ENJOY!
DonaldTrump	Will be interviewed on @NewDay on @CNN at 7:15 A.M.

DonaldTrump	In presidential voting so far, John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him, I will beat Hillary!
DonaldTrump	Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico, now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now!
DonaldTrump	Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate, until I put him down.
DonaldTrump	Mathematically it is statistically impossible for Kasich to get to 1237 - he would need 112% of the remaining delegates to be the nominee!

DonaldTrump	Don't reward Mitt Romney, who let us all down in the last presidential race, by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA, open borders etc.).
DonaldTrump	Please remember, I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists!
DonaldTrump	I will bring our jobs back to America, fix our military and take care of our vets, end Common Core and ObamaCare, protect 2nd A, build WALL
DonaldTrump	Rubio is weak on illegal immigration, with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
DonaldTrump	Kasich voted for NAFTA, a disaster for Ohio, and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness!

DonaldTrump	Ohio Gov.Kasich voted for NAFTA, from which Ohio has never recovered. Now he wants TPP, which will be even worse. Ohio steel and coal dying!

DonaldTrump	I only wish my wonderful father, Fred, gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight Rubio says. He didn't - total fabrication!

DonaldTrump	I am self-funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight Rubio or Ted Cruz!

DonaldTrump	Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is, he is a choker, and once a choker, always a choker! Mr. Meltdown.
DonaldTrump	Wow, every poll said I won the debate last night. Great honor!
DonaldTrump	Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage. Not presidential material!
DonaldTrump	Lying Ted Cruz and lightweight choker  Marco Rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement. They failed!
DonaldTrump	Will be at Fort Worth (Texas) Convention Center at 11:30 A.M. Big crowd - get there early! Big announcement to be made!
DonaldTrump	Why would the people of Florida vote for Marco Rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their Senator and then quit!
DonaldTrump	Have a good chance to win Texas on Tuesday. Cruz is a nasty guy, not one Senate endorsement and, despite talk, gets nothing done. Loser!

DonaldTrump	Just saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false, more dirty tricks. He got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy?
DonaldTrump	Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support!
DonaldTrump	Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics!
DonaldTrump	Wow, Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks!

DonaldTrump	Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. &amp; is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi, low interest loans. No legal disclosure &amp; never sold off assets.
DonaldTrump	Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.
DonaldTrump	Cruz says I supported TARP, which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs, the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet!
DonaldTrump	The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!
DonaldTrump	.@BrentBozell, one of the National Review lightweights, came to my office begging for money like a dog. Why doesn't he say that?

DonaldTrump	Great even in SC tonight! Fire Marshall would not let everyone in-- 5,000 turned away. Thank you for coming!
DonaldTrump	Will be at venue, in wonderful South Carolina, very soon. Big traffic back-up, tremendous crowd! Will be wild.

DonaldTrump	Love seeing union &amp; non-union members alike are defecting to Trump. I will create jobs like no one else. Their #Dem leaders can’t compete!
DonaldTrump	I hope all workers demand that their @Teamsters reps endorse Donald J. Trump. Nobody knows jobs like I do! Don’t let them sell you out!
DonaldTrump	On my way to South Carolina. Big Crowd--- look forward to it!
DonaldTrump	Not good news for Jeb Bush   __URL__ 
DonaldTrump	Hank Greenberg, formerly of AIG, gave $10 million to the @JebBush campaign 3 months ago. He is not happy, a total waste of money!

DonaldTrump	I'm leaving now for Burlington, Vermont. It will be wild!
DonaldTrump	Joy Behar, who was fired from her last show for lack of ratings, is even worse on @TheView. We love Barbara!
DonaldTrump	The @TheView @ABC, once great when headed by @BarbaraJWalters, is now in total freefall. Whoopi Goldberg is terrible. Very sad!

DonaldTrump	Weak &amp; ineffective @JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising!
DonaldTrump	I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster. Try using your last name and don't be ashamed of it!
DonaldTrump	.@SenTedCruz Ted--free legal advice on how to pre-empt the Dems on citizen issue. Go to court now &amp; seek Declaratory Judgment--you will win!
DonaldTrump	Massive crowd in VT tonight. Venue not big enough. Officials say NO to outside event and sound system. Arrive early!
DonaldTrump	Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level. Germany is a total mess-big crime. GET SMART!
DonaldTrump	I will be in beautiful Burlington, Vermont, tonight for a rally. Will be great fun. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
DonaldTrump	It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago. Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted!
DonaldTrump	.@Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&amp;P last year, plunging 46%. Very disloyal company. Another win for Trump! Boycott.
DonaldTrump	The failing @UnionLeader newspaper in N.H. just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads. How stupid, how desperate!
DonaldTrump	Do you believe that @UnionLeader in NH was demanding ads? Look at enclosed letter from them, just received:  __URL__

DonaldTrump	I don’t cheat at golf but @SamuelLJackson cheats—with his game he has no choice—and stop doing commercials!
DonaldTrump	HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my son, @EricTrump! Very proud of you!  __URL__   __URL__
