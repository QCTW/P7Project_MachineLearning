# Paris VII Machine Learning Project 2017

## Subject
In this project, we will use the machine learning techniques learned in the Master course "Fouille de Données et Aide à la Décision (Data Mining and Decision Support)" at Paris Diderot University in order to detect the plagiarism of text on the internet from intellectuals/copywriters.

We break our works into 3 milestones.

## First milestone
Identify the English writing style of the particular celebrity (politicians/writers). Ex: [Donlad Trump](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump), [Ivanka Trump](https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump), [Ellen DeGeneres](https://twitter.com/TheEllenShow)

[Sprint 1 Issues](https://github.com/QCTW/ParisVII_ProjectMachineLearning/milestone/1)
[Sprint 2 Issues](https://github.com/QCTW/ParisVII_ProjectMachineLearning/milestone/2)

## Second milestone
Create a bot that imitates the writing style of the chosen celebrity.

To see whether our algorithms can work with other languages or not, we would like to try with another language -- French as an extra test if there is time. We will identify the French writing style of particular celerity. Ex: [Emmanuel Macron](https://twitter.com/emmanuelmacron), [Jean-Luc Mélenchon](https://twitter.com/jlmelenchon?lang=en).

[Sprint 3 Issues](https://github.com/QCTW/ParisVII_ProjectMachineLearning/milestone/3)

## Final milestone
Scouting on the internet and try to identify the possible plagiarism of the sites -- particularly in the content farm and unauthorized advertisement context.
