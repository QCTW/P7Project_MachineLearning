# ParisVII Machine Learning Project 2017

## Subject
In this project, we will use the machine learning techniques learned in the Master course "Fouille de Données et Aide à la Décision (Data Minging and Decision Support)" at Paris Diderot University in order to detect the plagiarism on the internet from the text of intellectuals/copywriters.

We will break our work into 3 milestones.

## First milestone
Identify the writing style of particular celiberties (politicians/writers). Ex: Donlad Trump, Emmanuel Macron, Jean-Luc Mélenchon.

## Second milestone
Create a bot that imitates the writing style of the chosen celiberty.

## Final milestone
Scouting on the internet and try to identify the possible plagiarism of the sites -- particularly in the content farm and unauthorized advertisement context.
